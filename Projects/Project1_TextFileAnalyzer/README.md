**Text File Analyzer**

- Description: Develop a system that reads a text file and provides analytics such as word count, frequency of each word, the frequency of letters, number of paragraphs, etc.
- Concepts: BufferedReader, HashMap, StringTokenizer
- Extension: Add functionality to output the analyzed data into another text file.

**Pros**:
1. **Statelessness**: The `TextFileAnalyzer` class is now stateless, which means that it doesn't hold any state information between method calls. This makes it thread-safe and scalable.
2. **Decoupling**: `TextAnalysisResult` is now a separate class. This decoupling allows for better organization and potential reusability.
3. **Flexibility**: Having a `TextAnalysisResult` class allows you to store the analysis results and use or manipulate them as needed, including merging results from different analyses.
4. **Explicit Validations**: The `validateInputText` method helps ensure that only valid inputs are processed.
5. **Clear Method Responsibilities**: Each method in the `TextFileAnalyzer` class has a clear and distinct responsibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Cons**:
1. **Potential Overhead**: Splitting a string based on space and newline characters can be computationally expensive, especially for large input strings. Regex-based solutions in Java, while powerful, might introduce overheads.
2. **Duplicate Print Function**: There are two `printAnalytics` methods in the `TextAnalysisResult` class which do almost the same thing. This can be streamlined to avoid code repetition.
3. **Inefficient Preprocessing**: The preprocessing stage involves multiple regex operations one after another. These could potentially be optimized or combined for better performance.
4. **Limited Customizability**: The way the code is structured, if you wanted to add more analysis features or change the preprocessing logic, it might require considerable refactoring. For example, supporting more punctuation or analyzing different text structures.
5. **Lack of Handling for Edge Cases**: In the `wordFrequency` method, newline characters are removed, but in cases where words from two different lines are merged without a space, this can cause inaccuracies. For instance, "hello\nworld" would be processed as "helloworld".

**Todos**:
1. **Optimize Preprocessing**: Refine the preprocessing logic to make it more efficient.
2. **Streamline Printing**: Instead of having two `printAnalytics` methods, you could simplify and have just one that uses the instance variables directly.
3. **Expand Validations**: Consider adding more comprehensive validation checks.
4. **Enhance Data Structures**: Using more sophisticated data structures or third-party libraries (like Apache Commons or Guava) could optimize some operations, such as counting.
5. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of your logic and handle edge cases.
